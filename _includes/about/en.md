Hi everyone, I am Orville Yang and this is my blog. As I wrote in my first post, I had the idea of building a personal blog a long time ago, and thanks to numerous open source projects, I was able to implement this idea efficiently. I am a technology enthusiast and have dabbled in numerous fields. Therefore, I will write some tutorials and notes here, and also write down some thoughts and reflections.

We live in a time of rapid change, and I think that is exactly why I want to use words to document something. Most articles will be written in Chinese, and some will be provided with English translations In order to be accurate.
